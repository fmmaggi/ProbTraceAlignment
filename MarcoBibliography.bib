        abstract = {In the light of an increasing demand on business process
compliance, the verication of process models against compliance rules has become essential in enterprise computing. To be broadly applicable compliance checking has to support data-aware compliance rules as well as to consider data conditions within a process model. Independently of the actual technique applied to accomplish compliance checking, dataawareness means that in addition to the control ow dimension, the data dimension has to be explored during compliance checking. However, naive exploration of the data dimension can lead to state explosion. We address this issue by introducing an abstraction approach in this paper. We show how state explosion can be avoided by conducting compliance
checking for an abstract process model and abstract compliance rules.
Our abstraction approach can serve as preprocessing step to the actual
compliance checking and provides the basis for more ecient application
of existing compliance checking algorithms.}

	Abstract = {The management of business processes has recently received a lot of attention. One of the most interesting problems is the description of a process model in a language that allows the checking of the compliance of a process execution (or trace) to the model. In this paper we propose a language  for the representation of process models that is inspired to the SCIFF language and is an extension of clausal logic.
A process model is represented in the language as a set of integrity constraints that allow conjunctive formulas as disjuncts in the head.
We present an approach for inducing these models from data: we define a subsumption relation for the integrity constraints, we define a refinement operator and we adapt the algorithm ICL to the problem of learning such formulas. The system has been applied to the problem of inducing the model of a sealed bid auction and of the NetBill protocol. The data used for learning and testing were randomly generated from correct models of the processes.},
