  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, business processes are increasingly supported by IT services that produce massive amounts of event data during the execution of a process. This event data can be used to analyze the process using process mining techniques to discover the real process, measure conformance to a given process model, or to enhance existing models with performance information. Mapping the produced events to activities of a given process model is essential for conformance checking, annotation and understanding of process mining results. In order to accomplish this mapping with low manual effort, we developed a semiautomatic approach that maps events to activities using the solution of a corresponding constraint satisfaction problem. The approach extracts Declare constraints from both the log and the model to build matching constraints to efficiently reduce the number of possible mappings. The evaluation with an industry process model collection and simulated event logs demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach and its robustness towards non-conforming execution logs.},

  Abstract                 = {Embedded systems are specialized computers used in larger systems or machines to control equipments such as automobiles, home appliances, communication, control and office machines. Such pervasivity is particularly evident in immersive realities, i.e., scenarios in which invisible embedded systems need to continuously interact with human users, in order to provide continuous sensed information and to react to service requests from the users themselves. The SM4All project investigates an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services in immersive and person-centric environments, through the use of composability and semantic techniques for dynamic service reconfiguration. This is applied to the challenging scenario of private houses and home-care assistance in presence of users with different abilities and needs (e.g., young, able-bodied, aged and disabled). This paper presentes a brief overview of the SM4All system architecture.},

Available services are suitably composed and orchestrated in order to realize such a process. In particular we focus on smart homes, in which available services are those ones offered by sensor and actuator devices deployed in the home, and the target user process is directly and continuously controlled by the inhabitants, through actual goal choices. We provide a solver that synthesizes the orchestrator for the requested process and we show its practical applicability in a real smart home use case.},

  Abstract                 = {Declarative process models define the behaviour of business processes as a set of constraints. Declarative process discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. Existing discovery techniques verify the satisfaction of candidate constraints over the log, but completely neglect their interactions. As a result, the inferred constraints can be mutually contradicting and their interplay may lead to an inconsistent process model that does not accept any trace. In such a case, the output turns out to be unusable for enactment, simulation or verification purposes. In addition, the discovered model contains, in general, redundancies that are due to complex interactions of several constraints and that cannot be solved using existing pruning approaches. We address these problems by proposing a technique that automatically resolves conflicts within the discovered models and is more powerful than existing pruning techniques to eliminate redundancies. First, we formally define the problems of constraint redundancy and conflict resolution. Thereafter, we introduce techniques based on the notion of an automata-product monoid that guarantee the consistency of the discovered models and, at the same time, keep the most interesting constraints in the pruned set. We evaluate the devised techniques on real-world benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {The declarative modeling of workflows has been introduced to cope with flexibility in processes. Its rationale is based on the idea of stating some basic rules (named constraints), tying the execution of some activities to the enabling, requiring or disabling of other activities. What is not explicitly prohibited by such constraints is implicitly considered legal, w.r.t. the specification of the process. Declarative models for workflows are based on a taxonomy of constraint templates. Constraints are thus instances of constraint templates, applied to specific activities. Many algorithms for the automated discovery of declarative workflows associate to each constraint a support. The support is a statistical measure assessing to what extent a constraint was respected during the enactment(s) of the process. In current state-of-the-art literature, constraints having a support below a user-defined threshold are considered not valid for the process. Thresholds are useful for filtering out guesses based on possible misleading events, reported in logs either because of errors in the execution, unlikely process deviations, or wrong recordings in logs. The latter circumstance can be considered extremely relevant when logs are not written down directly by machines reporting their work, but extracted from other source of information. Here, we present an insight on the actual capacity of filtering constraints by modifying the threshold for support, on the basis of real data. Then, taking a cue from the results performed on such analysis, we consider the trend of support when controlled errors are injected into the log, w.r.t. individual constraint templates.

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays organizations support their creation of value by explicitly defining the processes to be carried out. Processes are specifically discussed from the angle of simplicity, i.e., how compact and easy to understand they can be represented. In most cases, organizations rely on imperative models which, however, become complex and cluttered when it comes to flexibility and optionality. As an alternative, declarative modeling reveals to be effective under such circumstances. While both approaches are well known for themselves, there is still not a deep understanding of their semantic interoperability. With this work, we examine the latter and show how to obtain an imperative model out of a set of declarative constraints. To this aim, we devise an approach leading from a Declare model to a behaviorally equivalent Petri net. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any declarative control flow can be represented by means of a Petri net for which the property of safety always holds true.},

Process discovery and conformance checking are the two main process mining tasks. Process discovery techniques can be used to learn a process model from example traces in an event log, whereas the goal of conformance checking is to compare the observed behavior in the event log with the modeled behavior. In this paper, we propose an approach based on temporal logic query checking, which is in the middle between process discovery and conformance checking. It can be used to discover those LTL-based business rules that are valid in the log, by checking against the log a (user-defined) class of rules. The proposed approach is not limited to provide a boolean answer about the validity of a business rule in the log, but it rather provides valuable diagnostics in terms of traces in which the rule is satisfied (witnesses) and traces in which the rule is violated (counterexamples). We have implemented our approach as a proof of concept and conducted a wide experimentation using both synthetic and real-life logs.},

  Abstract                 = {In the process mining field, several techniques have been developed during the last years, for the discovery of declarative process models from event logs. This type of models describes processes on the basis of temporal constraints. Every behavior that does not violate such constraints is allowed, and such characteristic has proven to be suitable for representing highly flexible processes. One way to test a process discovery technique is to generate an event log by simulating a process model, and then verify that the process discovered from such a log matches the original one. For this reason, a tool for generating event logs starting from declarative process models becomes vital for the evaluation of declarative process discovery techniques. In this paper, we present an approach for the automated generation of event logs, starting from process models that are based on Declare, one of the most used declarative modeling languages in the process mining literature. Our framework bases upon the translation of Declare constraints into regular expressions and on the utilization of Finite State Automata for the simulation. An evaluation of the implemented tool is presented, showing its effectiveness in both the generation of new logs and the replication of the behavior of existing ones. The presented evaluation also shows the capability of the tool of generating very large logs in a reasonably small amount of time, and its integration with state-of-the-art Declare modeling and discovery tools.},

Since such models are not defined a priori by experts but rather inferred from real-life scenarios that actually took place, they are guaranteed to respect the true executions (often Business Process Management tools are used to show the discrepancy between the supposed and the concrete workflows). Moreover, such models can be shared, compared, preserved, so that the best practices might be put in evidence from the community of knowledge workers, to the whole business benefit. Finally, an analysis over such processes can be done, so that bottlenecks and delays in actual executions can be found out.

Models created from automatic process discovery are meant to summarize complex behaviors in a compact way. Therefore, declarative models do not define all permissible behavior directly, but instead define constraints that must be met by each trace of the business process. While declarative models provide compactness, it is up until now not clear how robust or sensitive different constraints are with respect to noise. In this paper, we investigate this question from two angles. First, we establish a constraint hierarchy based on formal relationships between the different types of Declare constraints. Second, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of noise on different types of declarative rules. Our analysis reveals that an increasing degree of noise reduces support of many constraints. However, this effect is moderate on most of the constraint types, which supports the suitability of Declare for mining event logs with noise.},
