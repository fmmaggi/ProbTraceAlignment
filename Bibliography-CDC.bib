  Abstract                 = {Systems and infrastructures are currently being developed to support Web services. The main idea is to encapsulate an organization’s functionality within an appropriate interface and advertise it as Web services. While in some cases Web services may be utilized in an isolated form, it is normal to expect Web services to be integrated as part of Web processes. There is a growing consensus that Web services alone will not be sufficient to develop valuable Web processes due the degree of heterogeneity, autonomy, and distribution of the Web. Several researchers agree that it is essential for Web services to be machine understandable in order to support all the phases of the lifecycle of Web processes. This paper deals with two of the hottest R&D and technology areas currently associated with the Web — Web services and the Semantic Web. It presents how applying semantics to each of the steps in the Semantic Web Process lifecycle can help address critical issues in reuse, integration and scalability.},

  Abstract                 = {Most ontologies used in e-commerce are nowadays taxonomies with simple structure and loose semantics. One exception is the OPDM collection of ontologies, which express rich information about product categories and their parameters for a number of domains. Yet, having been created by different designers and with specific bias, such ontologies could still benefit from semi-automatic post-processing. We demonstrate how the versatile PatOMat framework for pattern-based ontology transformation can be exploited for suppressing incoherence within the collection and for adapting the ontologies for an unforeseen purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {Schema.org is one of the main drivers for the adoption of Semantic Web principles by a broad number of organizations and individuals for real business needs. GoodRelations is a well-established conceptual model for representing e-commerce information, one of the few widely used OWL DL ontologies, and since 2012 the official e-commerce model of schema.org.
In this tutorial, we will (1) give a comprehensive overview and hands-on training on the advanced conceptual structures of schema.org for e-commerce, including patterns for ownership and demand, (2) present the full tool chain for producing and consuming respective data, (3) explain the long-term vision of Linked Open Commerce, and (4) discuss advanced topics, like access control, identity and authentication (e.g. with WebID); micropayment services, and data management issues from the publisher and consumer perspective. We will also cover research opportunities resulting from the growing adoption and the respective amount of data in RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD syntaxes.},

  Abstract                 = {A core challenge in Business Process Management is the continuous, bi-directional translation between (1) a business requirements view on the process space of an enterprise and (2) the actual process space of this enterprise, constituted by the multiplicity of IT systems, resources, and human labor. Semantic Business Process Management (SBPM) [HeLD'05] is a novel approach of increasing the level of automation in the translation between these two spheres, and is currently driven by major players from the ERP, BPM, and Semantic Web Services domain, namely SAP2. One core paradigm of SPBM is to represent the two spheres and their parts using ontology languages and to employ machine reasoning for the automated or semi-automated translation. In this paper, we (1) outline the representational requirements of SBPM, (2) propose a set of ontologies and formalisms, and (3) define the scope of these ontologies by giving competency questions, which is a common technique in the ontology engineering process.},

  Abstract                 = {The classification of products and services enables reliable and efficient electronic exchanges of product data across organizations. Many companies classify products (a) according to generic or industry specific product classification standards, or (b) by using proprietary category systems. Such classification systems often contain thousands of product classes that are updated over time. This implies a large quantity of useful product category information for e-commerce applications on the Web of Data. Thus, instead of building up product ontologies from scratch, which is costly, tedious, error-prone, and high-maintenance, it is generally easier to derive them from existing classifications. In this paper, we (1) describe a generic, semi-automated method for deriving OWL ontologies from product classification standards and proprietary category systems. Moreover, we (2) show that our approach generates logically and semantically correct vocabularies, and (3) present the practical benefit of our approach. The resulting product ontologies are compatible with the GoodRelations vocabulary for e-commerce and with schema.org and can be used to enrich product and offer descriptions on the Semantic Web with granular product type information from existing data sources.},

  Abstract                 = {Taxonomies hierarchically organize concepts in a domain. Building and maintaining them by hand is a tedious and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a novel, unsupervised algorithm for automatically learning an IS-A taxonomy from scratch by analyzing a given text corpus. Our approach is designed to deal with infrequently occurring concepts so it can effectively induce taxonomies even from small corpora. Algorithmically, the approach makes two important contributions. First, it performs inference based on clustering and the distributional semantics, which can capture links among concepts never mentioned together. Second, it uses a novel graph-based algorithm to detect and remove incorrect is-a relations from a taxonomy. An empirical evaluation on five corpora demonstrates our proposed approach’s utility.},

  Abstract                 = {An outstanding introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis-updated and expanded The methods of regression analysis are the most widely used statistical tools for discovering the relationships among variables. This classic text, with its emphasis on clear, thorough presentation of concepts and applications, offers a complete, easily accessible introduction to the fundamentals of regression analysis. Assuming only a basic knowledge of elementary statistics, Applied Regression Analysis, Third Edition focuses on the fitting and checking of both linear and nonlinear regression models, using small and large data sets, with pocket calculators or computers. This Third Edition features separate chapters on multicollinearity, generalized linear models, mixture ingredients, geometry of regression, robust regression, and resampling procedures. Extensive support materials include sets of carefully designed exercises with full or partial solutions and a series of true/false questions with answers. All data sets used in both the text and the exercises can be found on the companion disk at the back of the book. For analysts, researchers, and students in university, industrial, and government courses on regression, this text is an excellent introduction to the subject and an efficient means of learning how to use a valuable analytical tool. It will also prove an invaluable reference resource for applied scientists and statisticians.}

  Abstract                 = {Many business domains are currently characterized by a move from an asset-orientation to a service-orientation: customers recognize that business value is not in owning assets, but in using the services offered by assets (which they do not need to own). This creates service-dominant business markets. The not-so-physical characteristics of these markets give rise to high levels of dynamism. This places high demands on the agility of service providers operating in these markets. These providers find their agility, however, heavily constrained by the business and IT platforms they use to deliver their services.
This paper proposes the BASE/X framework for agility in service-dominant business, which has been developed in the CoProFind project, a strategic collaboration between Eindhoven University of Technology and De Lage Landen International B.V. This framework makes two fundamental distinctions in the setup of a service-dominant business environment. Firstly, the framework separates two concepts in business conception: business strategy and business models. Business strategy is linked to the identity of an organization and hence is relatively stable in time. Business models specify the operation in the here and now of changing markets, and hence change frequently. Secondly, the framework separates two concepts in business implementation: service capabilities and service offerings. Service capabilities are relatively stable in time as they are based on the resources of an organization (both human and non-human). Service offerings change over time – they revolve with market dynamics as operationalization of network-centric business models of a provider. The framework provides a basis for structural agility by on the one hand coupling the stable elements to each other and on the other hand the fluid elements.
The concepts of BASE/X are combined in a service-dominant business structure that provides an operationalization of the framework. As this is a structure with stable outer layers and flexible inner layers, we call this the business sandwich model. Applying this sandwich model to the way business is organized thoroughly changes the traditional way of thinking in terms of decision horizons where it comes to implementing agility.
The business sandwich model describes the business view on agility. To enable automated support of agile business, the sandwich is mapped to an information system stack. This mapping how the business is connected to automated business applications at each of the layers of the sandwich. The information system stack is in its turn mapped to an infrastructure stack, which describes the basic IT platforms that form the implementation basis for the business applications.
The BASE/X framework described in this document is a structure for the development of new service-dominant business: business strategy, business models, their operationalization in service compositions, business services, and their implementation in state-of-the-art automated service management platforms. To aid in the use of this structure, the framework embeds tools that are tailored to business design in a service- dominant context. Application of the framework and its tools lead to well-structured management of the complexity of service-dominant business and short time-to-market of new business models. The approach is illustrated by a case study of an advanced travel industry service orchestrator.}

  Abstract                 = {In order to use Semantic Web technologies for the automation of E-Business tasks, like product search, content integration, or spend analysis, we need domain ontologies for products and services. The manual creation of such ontologies is problematic due to (1) the high degree of specificity, resulting in a very large number of needed concepts, and (2) the need for timely ontology maintenance due to the high conceptual dynamics caused by innovation in the products and services domain; and due to cost, since building such ontologies from scratch requires significant resources. On the other hand, industrial products and services categorization standards, like UNSPSC1, eCl@ss2, eOTD3, or the RosettaNet Technical Dictionary4 reflect some degree of community consensus and contain, readily available, a wealth of concept definitions plus a hierarchy. They can thus be valuable input for creating domain ontologies. However, the transformation of existing taxonomies into useful ontologies is not as straightforward as it appears, mainly because simply taking the hierarchy of concepts, which was originally developed for some external purpose other than ontology engineering, as the subsumption hierarchy can yield useless ontologies. In this paper, we (1) argue that for the products and services domain, deriving ontologies from industrial taxonomies is more feasible than manual ontology engineering due to the large number of concepts and the high conceptual dynamics, (2) show that the interpretation and representation of the original semantics of the input standard, especially the taxonomic relationship, is an important modeling decision that determines the usefulness of the resulting ontology, (3) illustrate the problem by analyzing DAML+OIL, OWL, and RDF-S ontologies derived from UNSPSC and eCl@ss, (4) present a comprehensive methodology for creating products and services ontologies in OWL based on the reuse of existing standards like eCl@ss and UNSPSC, and (5) demonstrate this approach by transforming eCl@ss 5.1 into a practically useful products and services ontology.},

It complements crisp logic-based semantic matching of OWL-S services with token-based syntactic similarity measurements in case the former fails. The results of the experimental evaluation of OWLS-MX provide strong evidence for the claim that logic-based semantic matching of OWL-S services can be significantly improved by incorporating non-logic-based information retrieval techniques. An additional analysis of false positives and false negatives of the hybrid matching filters of OWLS-MX led to an even further improved matchmaker version called OWLS-MX2.},

  Abstract                 = {Service orientation, customer focus and collaboration between firms are profoundly changing the way of doing business. Marketing scholars are the first academics to conceptualize these changes under a new mindset, known as the Service Dominant Logic. However, management constructs are needed to apply this mindset to the business environment. Therefore, we have developed a new conceptual model of a Service Dominant Strategy with a visual representation in the form of a canvas. Our model is constructed by integrating current definitions of a Service Dominant strategy and by confronting them with traditional strategies. The model facilitates the design of Service Dominant strategies by answering the questions associated with fifteen elements. Experimental application of our approach in several industry domains shows the importance of both strategic level design and Service Dominant thinking.},

Toward this goal, we suggest that an emerging logic of value creation and exchange called service-dominant logic is a more robust framework for service science than the traditional goods-dominant logic. The primary tenets of service-dominant logic are: (1) the conceptualization of service as a process, rather than a unit of output; (2) a focus on dynamic resources, such as knowledge and skills, rather than static resources, such as natural resources; and (3) an understanding of value as a collaborative process between providers and customers, rather than what producers create and subsequently deliver to customers. These tenets are explored and a foundational lexicon for service science is suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Service systems are value-co-creation configurations of people, technology, value propositionsconnecting internal and external service systems, and shared information (e.g., language, laws, measures, and methods). Service science is the study of service systems, aiming to create a basis for systematicservice innovation. Service science combines organization and human understanding with business andtechnological understanding to categorize and explain the many types of service systems that exist as wellas how service systems interact and evolve to co-create value. The goal is to apply scientific understandingto advance our ability to design, improve, and scale service systems. To make progress, we think servicedominantlogic provides just the right perspective, vocabulary, and assumptions on which to build a theory ofservice systems, their configurations, and their modes of interaction. Simply put, service-dominant logicmay be the philosophical foundation of service science, and the service system may be its basic theoreticalconstruct.},

  Abstract                 = {Service composition is gaining momentum as the potential silver bullet for the envisioned Semantic Web. It purports to take the Web to unexplored efficiencies and provide a flexible approach for promoting all types of activities in tomorrow’s Web. Applications expected to heavily take advantage of Web service composition include B2B E-commerce and E-government. To date, enabling composite services has largely been an ad hoc, time-consuming, and error-prone process involving repetitive low-level programming. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based framework for the automatic composition of Web services. We present a technique to generate composite services from high-level declarative descriptions. We define formal safeguards for meaningful composition through the use of composability rules. These rules compare the syntactic and semantic features of Web services to determine whether two services are composable. We provide an implementation using an E-government application offering customized services to indigent citizens. Finally, we present an exhaustive performance experiment to assess the scalability of our approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Marketing inherited a model of exchange from economics, which had a dominant logic based on the exchange of ``goods,'' which usually are manufactured output. The dominant logic focused on tangible resources, embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.},

  Abstract                 = {XML Schema Part 0: Primer is a non-normative document intended to provide an easily readable description of the XML Schema facilities, and is oriented towards quickly understanding how to create schemas using the XML Schema language. XML Schema Part 1: Structures and XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes provide the complete normative description of the XML Schema language. This primer describes the language features through numerous examples which are complemented by extensive references to the normative texts.},

  Abstract                 = {This book provides a comprehensive treatment of the field of Business Process Management (BPM) with a focus on Business Process Automation. It achieves this by covering a wide range of topics, both introductory and advanced, illustrated through and grounded in the YAWL (Yet Another Workflow Language) language and corresponding open-source support environment. In doing so it provides the reader with a deep, timeless, and vendor-independent understanding of the essential ingredients of business process automation. The BPM field is in a continual state of flux and is subject to both the ongoing proposal of new standards and the introduction of new tools and technology. Its fundamentals however are relatively stable and this book aims to equip the reader with both a thorough understanding of them and the ability to apply them to better understand, assess and utilize new developments in the BPM field.As a consequence of its topic-based format and the inclusion of a broad range of exercises, the book is eminently suitable for use in tertiary education, both at the undergraduate and the postgraduate level, for students of computer science and information systems. BPM researchers and practitioners will also find it a valuable resource. The book serves as a unique reference to a varied and comprehensive collection of topics that are relevant to the business process life-cycle.},
